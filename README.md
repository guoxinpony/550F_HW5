## why create the repo?
Due to some reason, some model are much larger than we expected, such as bagged tree model is 1.7 GB. We have tried many times, however, traning a model need more than **one hour**. Thus, we finally decided to save each model into RData file. Instructor/TA who want to run the submitted rmd file just need to download RData files into the same path of rmd file.
